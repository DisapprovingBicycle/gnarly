The intent of this repository is to create a simple game which uses the MelonJS engine, and to eventually use this platform to explore using artifical intelligence.

# Requirements

This project uses Node.js, Grunt and MelonJS

If you do not have Node.js installed please visit:

https://nodejs.org/

If you have Node.js installed but do not have Grunt then you can install it via node package manager (npm):

```npm install -g grunt-cli```

# Set up

```git clone git@github.com:DisapprovingBicycle/gnarly.git```

Then from the cloned folder use npm to install the required packages for the project:

```npm install```

To test out the game use Grunt from the project folder:

```grunt serve``

And then navigate to http://localhost:8000 on your broswer of choice to check it out.
